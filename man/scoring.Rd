\title{Normative Scoring}
\usage{
scoring(dat, scoring.table = NULL, norm = "overall", Age = "AGE",
  Gender = "GENDER")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An R dataframe object}

\item{scoring.table}{An R dataframe object that provides means and standard deviations for each normative option. See example section for details.}

\item{norm}{A character vector of length 1. Use "overall" for overall norms, and "agegender" for age and gender specific norms.}

\item{Age}{A character vector of length 1, used to indicate the name of the Age variable in dat.}

\item{Gender}{A character vector of length 1, used to indicate the name of the Gender variable in dat.}
}
\value{
An R dataframe object with N rows and K columns, where K is the number of scales included in dat.
}
\description{
\code{scoring} is a dual purpose function that returns a full dataframe that has
either been converted into standard scores based upon overall norms, or by
age and gender specific norms (based upon the norm argument). Age and Gender
are included as arguments simply to designate the names of the respective variables.
}
\details{
This function requires an external R dataframe called `scoring.table` that has the following structure: columns
called SCALE (with scale names that match those in `dat`), AGE, GENDER, MEAN, and SE.  For the rows pertaining to
overall norms, the AGE and GENDER values should be the character string "overall". See the example code for more details.
