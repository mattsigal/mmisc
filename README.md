## Matt's Miscellaneous Functions for MHS

This package contains a set of functions written for use at MHS. All pertain to psychometric issues, such as generating stratified normative samples, conducting normative scoring, and applying scoring exceptions.  Each function is linked with a help file (e.g., `?stratifiedNorm`), and `stratifiedNorm` also has a more thorough vignette included.
